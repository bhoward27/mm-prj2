# Running the Executable

The executable provided was compiled for Windows 10 on a Dell XPS 13. Unfortunately, it will not work for you on its own -- you need the Qt dll libraries to be installed in the same directory for it to work -- this is just the executable that's produced by Qt, there is nothing I can do about it. So unfortunately, you will need to install Qt Creator and compile from source code in order to the run program.

# Setup/Installation if the executable doesn't work

 - You can use macOS or Windows -- I can verify that my program works on both platforms, as I have tested it. If it doesn't work for you, please email me.
 - Install Qt Creator. This may take a long time. I apologize. Here is the link (which hopefully works) for the Qt installer: https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer?hsCtaTracking=99d9dd4f-5681-48d2-b096-470725510d34%7C074ddad0-fdef-4e53-8aa8-5e8a876d6ab4
 - Make sure that you install Qt Charts as one of the Additional Libraries during the installation
 - Open Qt Creator
 - Click File in the menu bar
 - Click Open File or Project
 - Find the mm-prj2 folder (which contains the source code for this project) and select mm-prj2.pro and click Open

# Running the program

 1. Read the report first and watch the demo video to understand how the program works.
 2. Click the green play button (Run) in Qt Creator. 
 3. You should see a window open with two big buttons: WAV and PNG. Click WAV to get started.
